Here is a quick data science project I was tasked with working on to be selected for an internship. Most of the work was don using R programming language and the bubble chart was
generated using Tableau. A company called Beans&Pods(not a real company) needs help in building an effective marketing campaign. However, they have no idea how to analyze their data. I approached my data exploration my trying to answer five simple questions.

1) which region is most popular?
2) is online or store more popular?
3) where are the most profitable channels?
4) which product is bought the most?
5) should we grow our online or store sales?

All of the questions are answered in the comments of the .rmd file and in the prepared presentation. But I will give you a sneak peak to the answer of #4


## Which product is bought the most?
